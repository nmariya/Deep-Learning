# Deep Learning

This includes a few coding assignments that demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural network(CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) applied to various classification problems. I have also demonstrated the generative models like Auto-encoders, particularly Deterministic Auto-Encoders(DAE), Variational Auto-Encoders(VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) which has significant applications in the field of Computer Vision.
